If you belong to a federal credit union, you may be able to get a payday alternative loan, or PAL, to borrow up to $2,000. The loans are meant to cost less than traditional payday loans and can be repaid over a longer period.

The rules set by the National Credit Union Administration were updated in 2019 to include:

    From one to 12 months are allowed to repay the loans.
    Federal credit union members can get a PAL immediately upon membership instead of waiting one month.
    Restricts a member to one type of PAL loan at a time.

The interest rate on a PAL is much lower than the 391% APR on a typical payday loan with a fee of $15 per $100 borrowed. The average payday loan borrower is in debt for five months in a year, spending $520 in fees to repeatedly borrow $375, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts.

PALs are meant to help members avoid other small-dollar loans by helping them build or repair credit records while graduating to other mainstream financial products, said NCUA Chairman Rodney E. Hood in a statement when the rules were changed.
